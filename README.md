# Simplest Working Calculator App
A graded assignment in fulfillment of the Meta Frontend Developer Course - React Basics

## App requirements
The graded assessment required me to complete a calculator in React. I was given code snippets, and tasked to use these, plus any of my code to complete the calculator that performs the four basic mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The app should also have a single input button, which will accept user input (any number) and a total starting with a zero.

Once a user types into the input field, they will then have to update the total by pressing any of the four math operation buttons:
- addition 
- subtraction
- multiplication
- division

To run the calculator app, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. If not, you can download it from the official <a href="https://nodejs.org" target="_blank">Node JS</a> website.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tettehnarh/simplest_calculator_app.git
```

3. Navigate to the React.js project directory

```bash
cd simplest_calculator_app
```

4. Install the project dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

5. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```
